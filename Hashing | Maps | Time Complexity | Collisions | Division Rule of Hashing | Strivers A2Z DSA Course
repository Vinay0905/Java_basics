Hashing:
Letâ€™s first try to understand the importance of hashing using an example:

Given an array of integers: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] and we are given some queries: [1, 3, 4, 2, 10]. For each query, we need to find out how many times the number appears in the array. For example, if the query is 1 our answer would be 2, and if the query is 4 the answer will be 0. 

Similarly, the following will be the answers to the given queries:




import java.util.*;

class tUf {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String s;
        s = sc.next();

        //precompute:
        int[] hash = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            hash[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        int q;
        q = sc.nextInt();
        while (q-- > 0) {
            char c;
            c = sc.next().charAt(0);
            // fetch:
            System.out.println(hash[c - 'a']);
        }
    }
}
